  abstract     = {{OBJECTIVE}: The growth of the biomedical literature presents special challenges for both human readers and automatic algorithms. One such challenge derives from the common and uncontrolled use of abbreviations in the literature. Each additional abbreviation increases the effective size of the vocabulary for a field. Therefore, to create an automatically generated and maintained lexicon of abbreviations, we have developed an algorithm to match abbreviations in text with their expansions.
                  {DESIGN}: Our method uses a statistical learning algorithm, logistic regression, to score abbreviation expansions based on their resemblance to a training set of human-annotated abbreviations. We applied it to Medstract, a corpus of {MEDLINE} abstracts in which abbreviations and their expansions have been manually annotated. We then ran the algorithm on all abstracts in {MEDLINE}, creating a dictionary of biomedical abbreviations. To test the coverage of the database, we used an independently created list of abbreviations from the China Medical Tribune.
                  {MEASUREMENTS}: We measured the recall and precision of the algorithm in identifying abbreviations from the Medstract corpus. We also measured the recall when searching for abbreviations from the China Medical Tribune against the database.
                  {RESULTS}: On the Medstract corpus, our algorithm achieves up to 83\% recall at 80\% precision. Applying the algorithm to all of {MEDLINE} yielded a database of 781,632 high-scoring abbreviations. Of all the abbreviations in the list from the China Medical Tribune, 88\% were in the database.
                  {CONCLUSION}: We have developed an algorithm to identify abbreviations from text. We are making this available as a public abbreviation server at {\textbackslash}url[http://abbreviation.stanford.edu/].},

  abstract     = {The volume of biomedical text is growing at a fast rate, creating challenges for humans and computer systems alike. One of these challenges arises from the frequent use of novel abbreviations in these texts, thus requiring that biomedical lexical ontologies be continually updated. In this paper we show that the problem of identifying abbreviations' definitions can be solved with a much simpler algorithm than that proposed by other research efforts. The algorithm achieves 96\% precision and 82\% recall on a standard test collection, which is at least as good as existing approaches. It also achieves 95\% precision and 82\% recall on another, larger test set. A notable advantage of the algorithm is that, unlike other approaches, it does not require any training data.},
